This week there has been lots of discussion around the office about networking more and the value of meetups and conferences. This is something I have pondered a lot recently and felt it was time to shared my thoughts on the subject.

### Conferences
Today [Zach Holman](https://twitter.com/holman) launched [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/), a resource for those thinking about speaking publicly. I first came across Zach last year when I had the opportunity to speak at the excellent FOWA (Future of Web Apps) conference run by [Future Insights](http://www.futureinsights.com). FOWA 2013 was my first time speaking at a conference and when I was looking for advice on how to design my slides I found [Slide Design for Developers](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/). As a developer with little design skills Zach's advice was invaluable and the influence of his post cans be seen clearly in my [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/hpoom/how-to-build-a-unified-api).

Zach has many great posts from [The Conference Circuit](http://zachholman.com/posts/the-conference-circuit/) to [What They Don't Tell You About Public Speaking](http://zachholman.com/posts/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-public-speaking/), but it is his recent post [GitHub's Public Speaking Culture](http://zachholman.com/posts/github-speaking-culture/) that really expresses the same views I have on why speaking is good for you and your employee. I can't write it better so I just encourage you to go and read Zach's posts.

Speaking was great for me, and I can't wait to get the opportunity to do it again.

### Meetups
As well as conferences the other avenue we have to network more is meetups. In the last twelve months I have got involved in meetups a lot more. From just attending through to speaking at events, it has been a lot of fun. I have meet some interesting people and it has really opened my eyes to how powerful the meetup really is. 

The best find recently for me has been the [codeHarbour](http://www.meetup.com/codeharbour/) meetup. In Kent where I am based we don't have many meetups. You either need to jump on a train to London or just miss out. [Wez](https://twitter.com/wesleyburden/) and [Keith](https://twitter.com/keithdevon/) have done a great job of getting web people in Kent to meet regularly over a beer or two and talk about the web and how we can make it better.

Just this week I have seen this meetup culture spread. I had an interesting chat with [Natalie](https://twitter.com/nataadams80) at work and it looks like Holiday Extras might be using the new Academy space in the future to run a new meetup. [Talkshop Kent](http://www.meetup.com/Talkshop-Kent/) looks like it is going to be a great forum for chat about all areas of business and technology.

### Conclusion 
So to close I am not sure I know the magic answer to how you can get people to network more. All I can do it tell you it will benefit you in numerous ways and I encourage you to get out yourself and attend meetups and conferences. Who knows where it will lead, you might be a speaker on the rising stars track of FOWA 2014, as I was last year.

I will leave you with a few more of Zach Holman's wise words.
