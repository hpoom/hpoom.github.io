	<p>This week there has been lots of discussion around the office about networking more and the value of meetups and conferences. This is something I have pondered a lot recently an felt it was time to shared my thoughts on the subject.</p>
<h3>Conferences</h3>
<p>Today <a href="https://twitter.com/holman">Zach Holman</a> launched <a href="http://speaking.io/">speaking.io</a>, a resource for those thinking about speaking publicly. I first came across Zach last year when I had the opportunity to speak at the excellent FOWA (Future of Web Apps) conference run by <a href="http://www.futureinsights.com">Future Insights</a>. FOWA 2013 was my first time speaking at a conference and when I was looking for advice on how to design my slides I stumbled across <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/">Slide Design for Developers</a>. As a developer with little design skills Zach&#39;s advice was invaluable and the influence of his post cans be seen clearly in my <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hpoom/how-to-build-a-unified-api">slides</a></p>
<p>Zach has many great posts from <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/the-conference-circuit/">The Conference Circuit</a> to <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-public-speaking/">What They Don&#39;t Tell You About Public Speaking</a>, but it is his recent post <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/github-speaking-culture/">GitHub&#39;s Public Speaking Culture</a> that really expresses the same views I have on why speaking is good for you and your employee. I can&#39;t write it better so I just encourage you to go and read Zach&#39;s posts.</p>
<p>Speaking was great for me, and I can&#39;t wait to get the opportunity to do it again.</p>
<h3>Meetups</h3>
<p>As well as conferences the other avenue we have to network more is meetups. In the last twelve months I have got involved in meetups a lot more. From just attending through to speaking at events, it has been a lot of fun. I have meet some interesting people and it has really opened my eyes to how powerful the meetup really is. </p>
<p>The best find of the year for me has been the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codeharbour/">codeHarbour</a> meetup. In Kent where I am based we don&#39;t have many meetups. You either need to jump on a train to London or just miss out. <a href="https://twitter.com/wesleyburden/">Wez</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/keithdevon/">Keith</a> have done a great job of getting web people in Kent to meet regularly over a beer or two and talk about the web and how we can make it better.</p>
<p>Just this week I have seen this meetup culture spread. An interesting chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/nataadams80">Natalie</a> at work and it looks like Holiday Extras might be using the new Academy space in the future to run a new meetup. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Talkshop-Kent/">Talkshop Kent</a> looks like it is going to be a great forum for chat about all areas of business and technology.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So to close I am not sure I know the magic answer to how you can get people to network more. All I can do it tell you it will benefit you in numerous ways and I encourage you to get out yourself and attend meetups and conferences. Who knows where it will lead, you might be a speaker on the rising stars track of FOWA 2014, as I was last year.</p>
<p>I will leave you with a few more of Zach Holman&#39;s wise words.</p>
