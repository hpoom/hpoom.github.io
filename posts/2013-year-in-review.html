	<p>So for a while now I have thought about writing a <em>&quot;Year in Review&quot;</em> post annually. As I am working on actively blogging again this year is the perfect year to start.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>It has been another excellent year in my job at <a href="http://shortbreaks.holidayextras.co.uk" title="Holiday Extras - Shortbreaks">Holiday Extras</a>. It has been challenging at times, but I would not enjoy my job so much if it was not challenging. I have an excellent team and it has been great to see them grow and develop over the past twelve months.</p>
<p>Hilight of the year for me would be getting the chance to speak at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/fowa-london/" title="Future of Web Apps - London 2013">FOWA</a>. I have wanted to try my hand a speaking for some time now and I really enjoyed the experience of getting on stage and talking about APIs. The feedback was excellent and I enjoyed networking and answering attendees questions after my talk. I have caught the speaking bug now. I&#39;m looking forward to doing some more tech speaking in 2014.</p>
<p>As well as FOWA I had the chance to attend a few more conferences this year. Five conferences in total in 3 countries.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/aws-summit-london/">AWS Summit 2013</a> - April - London</li>
<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/gbnc/">The Great British Node Conference</a> - September - London</li>
<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/dws/">Dublin Web Summit 2013</a> - October - Dublin</li>
<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/apidays2013/">API Days 2013</a> - December - Paris</li>
</ul>
<p>The last good work point of 2013 was that I managed to do a lot more networking. I got out the office more and got talking to some great people. I et <a href="https://twitter.com/sydlawrence">Syd Lawrence</a> at The Great British Node Conference and then again at the Twilio Night Summit event at Web Summit. I also got chatting to <a href="https://twitter.com/EamonLeonard">Eamon Leonard</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coldfumonkeh">Matt Gifford</a> at the FOWA speakers dinner. I went on to see Eamon again at Web Summit where he organised a great line up of speakers on the Developers Stage.</p>
<p>I discovered a great local web meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codeharbour/">codeHarbour</a>. Which again got me crossing paths with some interesting people.</p>
<p>All in all an excellent work year!</p>
<h3>Myself</h3>
<p>I started the year with a detox in support of my wife doing her detox diet. This was good and I lost 1/2 a stone. Unfortunately it did not last. I now own a spin bike at home, but have not made enough use of it. So next year I must eat better and exercise a lot more. Maybe I will start cycling to work again.</p>
<p>I must also get my blog in order and make an effort to blog more!</p>
<h3>Discoveries</h3>
<p>To end my year in review I thought it would be great to list some of the things I have discovered over the course of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Music</strong> - Best cover of the year for me was <strong>Daughter - &quot;Get Lucky&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Top Purchase</strong> - My best purchase this year was my <strong>HTC One</strong> Phone.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> - Discovered static site builders using <strong>Grunt</strong>. More on this in a future blog post.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>2013 was a pretty good year. Lets see if we can make 2014 even better.</p>
